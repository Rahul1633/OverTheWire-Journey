# OverTheWire-Journey
This repository documents my progress through [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/).  
I’m using these challenges to strengthen my **Linux**, **networking**, and **problem-solving** skills.  
*No solutions or flags are shared — only the concepts and commands I practiced.*
